# Scrapster
Scrapster is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of electronic waste (e-waste) and scrap materials. The project consists of two main components: a client-side application (in the ewaste-client folder) and a server-side API (in the ewaste-server folder). The live API is deployed at scrapster-api.vercel.app.

# Tech Stack
